%description
`image_geometry` contains C++ and Python libraries for interpreting images
geometrically. It interfaces the calibration parameters in
sensor_msgs/CameraInfo messages with OpenCV functions such as image
rectification, much as cv_bridge interfaces ROS sensor_msgs/Image with OpenCV
data types.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
